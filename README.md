# Learning Jenkins
I'm sharing my journey of learning Jenkins and how itâ€™s helping me grow in DevOps! This will be the general outline for my progression:
<li>Jenkins Pipelines: What they are and how they are used</li>
<li>Parameterized jobs: Pass information between the different jobs</li>
<li>Integration with GitHub: Jenkins and GitHub go hand-in-hand</li>
<li>Breakdown of how to use Jenkinsfiles: From the ground up and for a complete beginner</li>
<li>Jenkinsfiles and Declarative Pipelines</li>
<li>Scripting your CI/CD solution</li>
<li>Functions in your Jenkins pipelines</li>
<li>Multistage Pipelines in Code</li>
<li>Declarative Pipeline Language</li>
